The assignment was about the N-queen problem. It involves finding the optimal solution by implementing the Genetic Algorithm. We made an array of Individuals called Population. Each individual contains an array showing the solution. The optimal solution is selected based on its fitness, which is the number of conflicts of the queens in each individual.
The algorithm involves crossing over two individuals, mutating an indivdual, generation of individuals and finally printing the number of generations, the best solution in the population.
